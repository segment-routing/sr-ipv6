Maxim MAX30100 heart rate and pulse oximeter sensor

* https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX30100.pdf

Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "maxim,max30100"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor
  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
  interrupt client node bindings.

Example:

max30100@057 {
	compatible = "maxim,max30100";
	reg = <57>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <16 2>;
};
