- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- phy: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- clocks: List of clocks for this device. At least one clock is

Example:

ethernet@d0070000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-370-neta";
	reg = <0xd0070000 0x2500>;
	interrupts = <8>;
	clocks = <&gate_clk 4>;
	tx-csum-limit = <9800>
	status = "okay";
	phy = <&phy0>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii-id";
};
