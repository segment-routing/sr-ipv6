* Texas Instruments wl1271 wireless lan controller

The wl1271 chip can be connected via SPI or via SDIO. This
document describes the binding for the SPI connected chip.

Required properties:
- compatible :          Should be "ti,wl1271"
- reg :                 Chip select address of device
- spi-max-frequency :   Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- ref-clock-frequency : Reference clock frequency
- interrupt-parent, interrupts :
                        Should contain parameters for 1 interrupt line.
                        Interrupt parameters: parent, line number, type.
- vwlan-supply :        Point the node of the regulator that powers/enable the wl1271 chip

Optional properties:
- clock-xtal :          boolean, clock is generated from XTAL

- Please consult Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
  for optional SPI connection related properties,

Examples:

&spi1 {
	wl1271@1 {
		compatible = "ti,wl1271";

		reg = <1>;
		spi-max-frequency = <48000000>;
		clock-xtal;
		ref-clock-frequency = <38400000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
		interrupts = <8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		vwlan-supply = <&vwlan_fixed>;
	};
};
