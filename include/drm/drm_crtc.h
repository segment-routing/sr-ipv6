	 * vertical blanking, avoiding tearing (except when requested otherwise
	 * through the DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC flag). When an application

	 * is large enough to be scanned out by the CRTC in the currently
	 * configured mode and then calls the CRTC ->page_flip() operation with a
	 * pointer to the new frame buffer.
	 *
	 * The driver must wait for any pending rendering to the new framebuffer
	 * to complete before executing the flip. It should also wait for any
	 * pending rendering from other drivers if the underlying buffer is a
	 * shared dma-buf.
	 *
	 * An application can request to be notified when the page flip has
	 * completed. The drm core will supply a struct &drm_event in the event
	 * parameter in this case. This can be handled by the
	 * drm_crtc_send_vblank_event() function, which the driver should call on
	 * the provided event upon completion of the flip. Note that if
	 * the driver supports vblank signalling and timestamping the vblank
	 * counters and timestamps must agree with the ones returned from page
	 * flip events. With the current vblank helper infrastructure this can
	 * be achieved by holding a vblank reference while the page flip is
	 * pending, acquired through drm_crtc_vblank_get() and released with
	 * drm_crtc_vblank_put(). Drivers are free to implement their own vblank
	 * counter and timestamp tracking though, e.g. if they have accurate
	 * timestamp registers in hardware.
	 *

	 * unfortunately does not (yet) take care of that. Therefore drivers
	 * currently must clean up and release pending events in their
	 * ->preclose driver function.
	 *
	 * This callback is optional.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * Very early versions of the KMS ABI mandated that the driver must
	 * block (but not reject) any rendering to the old framebuffer until the
	 * flip operation has completed and the old framebuffer is no longer
	 * visible. This requirement has been lifted, and userspace is instead
	 * expected to request delivery of an event and wait with recycling old
	 * buffers until such has been received.
	 *
	 * RETURNS:
	 *
	 * 0 on success or a negative error code on failure. Note that if a
	 * ->page_flip() operation is already pending the callback should return
	 * -EBUSY. Pageflips on a disabled CRTC (either by setting a NULL mode
	 * or just runtime disabled through DPMS respectively the new atomic

	 *
	 *  - Checking that virtualized resources exported to userspace are not
	 *    oversubscribed. For various reasons it can make sense to expose
	 *    more planes, crtcs or encoders than which are physically there. One
	 *    example is dual-pipe operations (which generally should be hidden

	 *    shared a hardware plane with a 2nd plane (if there's a compatible
	 *    plane requested on the area handled by the other pipe).
	 *
	 *  - Check that any transitional state is possible and that if
	 *    requested, the update can indeed be done in the vblank period
	 *    without temporarily disabling some functions.
	 *
	 *  - Check any other constraints the driver or hardware might have.
	 *
	 *  - This callback also needs to correctly fill out the &drm_crtc_state
	 *    in this update to make sure that drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset()
	 *    reflects the nature of the possible update and returns true if and
	 *    only if the update cannot be applied without tearing within one
	 *    vblank on that CRTC. The core uses that information to reject
	 *    updates which require a full modeset (i.e. blanking the screen, or
	 *    at least pausing updates for a substantial amount of time) if
	 *    userspace has disallowed that in its request.

	 * The drm core will supply a struct &drm_event in the event

	 * drm_crtc_vblank_put(). Drivers are free to implement their own vblank
	 * counter and timestamp tracking though, e.g. if they have accurate
	 * timestamp registers in hardware.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * Drivers are not allowed to shut down any display pipe successfully

	 *
	 *  - -EBUSY, if an asynchronous updated is requested and there is
